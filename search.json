    "text": "Keynote Addresses\n\n\n\nStephanie Hicks\nStatistical Challenges in Single-Cell and Spatial Transcriptomics\nThursday, June 13\n\n\nBiography\nDr. Stephanie Hicks is an Associate Professor in the Department of Biomedical Engineering and Biostatistics at Johns Hopkins University where she has affiliations with the Malone Center for Engineering in Healthcare, Center for Computational Biology, the Department of Genetic Medicine, and the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. She is an expert in developing scalable computational methods and open-source software for biomedical data analysis, in particular single-cell and spatial transcriptomics genomics data, leading to an improved understanding of human health and disease. She serves on a variety of boards including the Bioconductor Technical Advisory Board, and the Editorial Board at Genome Biology and the Journal of American Statistical Association. Locally, she co-founded and co-organizes the R-Ladies Baltimore chapter to promote gender diversity in the R programming language community. She is a recipient of several professional awards including a K99/R00 Pathway to Independence Award, a High-Impact Project Award from the Bloomberg American Health Initiative, Teaching in the Health Sciences Young Investigator Award from the American Statistical Association (ASA), Harvard University’s Myrto Lefkopoulou Award for excellence in Biostatistics, and the COPSS Emerging Leader Award from the ASA, arguably the statistical profession’s most prestigious award for early career leaders in Statistics and Data Science. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGundula Bosch\nReproducibility in Biomedical Research Education \nFriday, June 14\n\n\nBiography\nGundula Bosch, PhD, MEd ’16, MS, is a scientist and educator leading global education reform through training programs in critical, broad, and interdisciplinary scientific thinking. She is the director of the R3 Center for Innovation and Science Education at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health.\nAs an interdisciplinary scientist with joint appointments at the Johns Hopkins Schools of Public Health and Education, Dr. Bosch’s research focus lies in implementation science and the development of valid metrics to assess outcomes and impact of interventions in graduate science and health education, nationally and globally. In her function as the Director of the R3 Center for Innovation in Science Education (R3ISE) at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Dr. Bosch developed and leads the R3 Graduate Science Programs (PMID: 29259084; PMID: 29446388) that stand for “the three R’s” of good scientific practice: Rigor in research conduct, Reproducibility of results, and Responsibility of scientists to society. Originally from Munich, Germany, she holds a Ph.D. in Biology from the Max-Planck-Institute of Biochemistry and a master’s degree in Education from Johns Hopkins.\nUnder Dr. Bosch’s leadership, the R3ISE team offers graduate-level programs that bring formal training in critical thinking, quantitative reasoning, sound research methodology, interdisciplinary collaboration, ethical decision-making, responsible communication, and social justice into graduate student training in biomedicine, public health, engineering, and technology (PMID: 35570294; PMID: 37289659). Through the global R3ISEnetwork of scientist-educators, these training experiences are available to all graduate and post-graduate trainees at Johns Hopkins, as well as national and international partner institutions.\n\n\n\n\n\nBROUGHT TO YOU BY\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoin our mailing list to hear all the latest about events, news and more\n\n\n\n\n\nHELP EDIT THIS WEBSITE\nThis entire website was made using Quarto and R.\nIf you notice any problems or have any additions please submit a Pull Request to our public GitHub Repo"

    "text": "How can we optimize medication treatments for opioid use disorder?\nWhich individuals are more at risk of dropping out of a treatment program?\nWhich individuals are more at risk of relapsing?\n\nThe R/Medicine planning committee welcomes your participation in the virtual R/Medicine data challenge. Participants will have from now until May 17th, 2024 to work on submissions for the challenge. There will 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place prizes for overall quality of analyses/Quarto docs, as well as prizes for 2 honorable mention categories: best table and best visualization.\nIt is well known that opioid use disorder is currently a major public health concern that has significant implications for the entire healthcare system. Understanding more about how we can best develop effective treatment programs is needed now more than ever as we continue to combat the opioid epidemic.\n\n\nIn this data challenge, you will analyze various factors that may contribute to either treatment success or treatment failure for opioid use disorder using harmonized data collected from three multi-site clinical trials from the CTN. We encourage you to read more about how this data was collected here.\nWe ask that all analyses be done and submitted as Quarto documents. Participants can submit as an individual or as part of a team (but not both). The maximum team size is 3. Your goal will be to transform these datasets into actionable indicators that illustrate which factors are important to understanding why some patients achieve success with treatment for opioid use disorder and why others drop out or relapse.\nThe data for this challenge is available on CRAN.The following 2 code chunks demonstrate how to install and load the necessary packages. You can read more about the packages on CRAN here and here.\n\ninstall.packages(\"public.ctn0094data\")\ninstall.packages(\"public.ctn0094extra\")\n\n\nlibrary(public.ctn0094data)\nlibrary(public.ctn0094extra)\n\nIn addition to the provided data, you may request to use additional publicly available data in your submission by submitting a request by May 1st, 2024 at 5:00PM EST. If approved, the data will be made available to all participants.\nYou will be evaluated by judges based on the relevance, completeness, and quality of your submission. Remember that tables and visualizations will also be judged and ranked separately for the prizes of best table and best visualization. Judges include:\nRaymond Balise, PhD, University of Miami\nPeter Higgins, MD, PhD, MSc, University of Michigan\nBryan P. Mayfield, PharmD, MS, Precision Analytical\n\n\n\nWhich demographic characteristics are most associated with drop out/relapse rates?\nAre there any drugs/substances that seem to be more associated with higher or lower drop out/relapse rates?\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen: Now - May 17th, 2024\nWhere: The R/Medicine data challenge is entirely virtual, with information and rules of the challenge available on this website. Updates will be posted on this website.\nWho you are: We welcome any participants over age 18, especially undergraduate students, graduate students, and early professional data scientists and biostatisticians. Analysts based in academic institutions, government statistical offices, think tanks, policy labs, and community organizations are encouraged to participate.\nWhat topics you can explore: Participants can analyze the included opioid use disorder data in tandem with with any other related publicly available data submitted for approval before May 1st, 2024.\nSubmissions and evaluation: Participants will conduct their analyses and submit a short project narrative that describes the research question, analytic approach, and key findings. We encourage participants to find creative ways to incorporate tables, visualizations, and other aspects of data storytelling to create a compelling narrative. In addition to their completed analysis with the indicators they used, participants will be asked to submit documentation describing each step of their process.

    "text": "How can we optimize medication treatments for opioid use disorder?\nWhich individuals are more at risk of dropping out of a treatment program?\nWhich individuals are more at risk of relapsing?\n\nThe R/Medicine planning committee welcomes your participation in the virtual R/Medicine data challenge. Participants will have from now until May 17th, 2024 to work on submissions for the challenge. There will 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place prizes for overall quality of analyses/Quarto docs, as well as prizes for 2 honorable mention categories: best table and best visualization.\nIt is well known that opioid use disorder is currently a major public health concern that has significant implications for the entire healthcare system. Understanding more about how we can best develop effective treatment programs is needed now more than ever as we continue to combat the opioid epidemic.\n\n\nIn this data challenge, you will analyze various factors that may contribute to either treatment success or treatment failure for opioid use disorder using harmonized data collected from three multi-site clinical trials from the CTN. We encourage you to read more about how this data was collected here.\nWe ask that all analyses be done and submitted as Quarto documents. Participants can submit as an individual or as part of a team (but not both). The maximum team size is 3. Your goal will be to transform these datasets into actionable indicators that illustrate which factors are important to understanding why some patients achieve success with treatment for opioid use disorder and why others drop out or relapse.\nThe data for this challenge is available on CRAN.The following 2 code chunks demonstrate how to install and load the necessary packages. You can read more about the packages on CRAN here and here.\n\ninstall.packages(\"public.ctn0094data\")\ninstall.packages(\"public.ctn0094extra\")\n\n\nlibrary(public.ctn0094data)\nlibrary(public.ctn0094extra)\n\nIn addition to the provided data, you may request to use additional publicly available data in your submission by submitting a request by May 1st, 2024 at 5:00PM EST. If approved, the data will be made available to all participants.\nYou will be evaluated by judges based on the relevance, completeness, and quality of your submission. Remember that tables and visualizations will also be judged and ranked separately for the prizes of best table and best visualization. Judges include:\nRaymond Balise, PhD, University of Miami\nPeter Higgins, MD, PhD, MSc, University of Michigan\nBryan P. Mayfield, PharmD, MS, Precision Analytical\n\n\n\nWhich demographic characteristics are most associated with drop out/relapse rates?\nAre there any drugs/substances that seem to be more associated with higher or lower drop out/relapse rates?\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen: Now - May 17th, 2024\nWhere: The R/Medicine data challenge is entirely virtual, with information and rules of the challenge available on this website. Updates will be posted on this website.\nWho you are: We welcome any participants over age 18, especially undergraduate students, graduate students, and early professional data scientists and biostatisticians. Analysts based in academic institutions, government statistical offices, think tanks, policy labs, and community organizations are encouraged to participate.\nWhat topics you can explore: Participants can analyze the included opioid use disorder data in tandem with with any other related publicly available data submitted for approval before May 1st, 2024.\nSubmissions and evaluation: Participants will conduct their analyses and submit a short project narrative that describes the research question, analytic approach, and key findings. We encourage participants to find creative ways to incorporate tables, visualizations, and other aspects of data storytelling to create a compelling narrative. In addition to their completed analysis with the indicators they used, participants will be asked to submit documentation describing each step of their process. The documentation should be detailed enough as to make the project fully replicable. The narrative, methods, organization, and documentation of each participant’s project will be evaluated for relevance, completeness, and quality. More information on evaluation will be added to the FAQs section at the bottom of this page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1st Place\n2nd Place\n3rd Place\n\n\n\n\nBest Overall Analysis/Quarto Doc\nFree Posit Conf 2024 Registration\n$300 off Posit Conf 2024 Registration\n$100 off Posit Conf 2024\n\n\n\nBest Table - $500 off Posit Conf 2024 Registration\nBest Visualization - $500 off Posit Conf 2024 Registration\nFinalists will be required to present their project at the R/Medicine conference (can be prerecorded).\n\n\n\nQuestion: Are IDs of the care team or individual case workers associated with site/clinic visits available?\nAnswer: No. The granular details on treatment site and care providers are masked to assure the anonymity of the patients.

This language barrier significantly restricts access for individuals who do not speak English proficiently. As a result, Spanish-speaking communities often face considerable challenges in accessing software training opportunities. This disparity leads to inequities in the distribution and utilization of scientific technologies, which is particularly concerning given the increasing importance of digital skills nowadays. To mitigate these challenges and promote inclusivity, we propose conducting a programming workshop in Spanish during the conference. This initiative aims to bridge the gap by providing Spanish-speaking participants with equal opportunities to engage with and benefit from technological advancements. By doing so, we not only enhance individual capabilities but also contribute to a more equitable distribution of educational resources in the scientific community. This workshop will equip attendees with basic skills in R. Our primary objective is to familiarize participants with RStudio and its key features for generating reproducible reports. We will guide attendees through the process of creating and managing projects in RStudio and introduce them to creating reproducible manuscripts using Quarto documents. The workshop will utilize a publicly available dataset from the CDC, which contains information on drug use and suicidal ideation among adolescents, as a practical example of using R for academic research in public health. We will explain how to use functions such as filter, mutate, summarize, and select from the tidyverse suite of packages. We will conclude by demonstrating how to use ggplot2 to create visualizations in R. By the end of the workshop, participants will have created a, reproducible document in HTML format, detailing the data cleaning steps and analysis of a significant, contemporary social issue. This presentation aims to close the gap in programming literacy among Spanish-speaking researchers and promote methods for reproducible scientific inquiry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA pesar de los abundantes recursos disponibles para aprender R, la mayoría de estos materiales son accesibles principalmente para angloparlantes.

Instead of one large data frame that contains all the data from your project, you get to work with a set of tidy tibbles, one for each REDCap instrument.\n\n\n\nStephan can be found automating everything at CHOP, on Twitter at @StephanKadauke, and promoting reproducible medical research with R.\nWill can be found working on improving REDCap Workflows, and supporting a variety of research studies at OUHSC."

    "text": "Despite the abundant resources available for learning R, most of these materials are primarily accessible to English speakers. This language barrier significantly restricts access for individuals who do not speak English proficiently. As a result, Spanish-speaking communities often face considerable challenges in accessing software training opportunities. This disparity leads to inequities in the distribution and utilization of scientific technologies, which is particularly concerning given the increasing importance of digital skills nowadays. To mitigate these challenges and promote inclusivity, we propose conducting a programming workshop in Spanish during the conference. This initiative aims to bridge the gap by providing Spanish-speaking participants with equal opportunities to engage with and benefit from technological advancements. By doing so, we not only enhance individual capabilities but also contribute to a more equitable distribution of educational resources in the scientific community. This workshop will equip attendees with basic skills in R. Our primary objective is to familiarize participants with RStudio and its key features for generating reproducible reports. We will guide attendees through the process of creating and managing projects in RStudio and introduce them to creating reproducible manuscripts using Quarto documents. The workshop will utilize a publicly available dataset from the CDC, which contains information on drug use and suicidal ideation among adolescents, as a practical example of using R for academic research in public health. We will explain how to use functions such as filter, mutate, summarize, and select from the tidyverse suite of packages. We will conclude by demonstrating how to use ggplot2 to create visualizations in R. By the end of the workshop, participants will have created a, reproducible document in HTML format, detailing the data cleaning steps and analysis of a significant, contemporary social issue. This presentation aims to close the gap in programming literacy among Spanish-speaking researchers and promote methods for reproducible scientific inquiry."

    "text": "A pesar de los abundantes recursos disponibles para aprender R, la mayoría de estos materiales son accesibles principalmente para angloparlantes. Esta barrera del idioma restringe significativamente el acceso de personas que no hablan inglés con fluidez. Como resultado, las comunidades de habla hispana a menudo enfrentan desafíos considerables para acceder a oportunidades de capacitación en software. Esta disparidad conduce a desigualdades en la distribución y utilización de las tecnologías científicas, lo que es particularmente preocupante dada la creciente importancia de las habilidades digitales en la actualidad. Para mitigar estos desafíos y promover la inclusión, proponemos realizar un taller de programación en español durante la conferencia. Esta iniciativa tiene como objetivo cerrar la brecha brindando a los participantes de habla hispana igualdad de oportunidades para interactuar y beneficiarse de los avances tecnológicos. Al hacerlo, no sólo mejoramos las capacidades individuales sino que también contribuimos a una distribución más equitativa de los recursos educativos en la comunidad científica. Este taller equipará a los asistentes con habilidades básicas en R. Nuestro objetivo principal es familiarizar a los participantes con RStudio y sus características clave para generar informes reproducibles. Guiaremos a los asistentes a través del proceso de creación y gestión de proyectos en RStudio y les presentaremos la creación de manuscritos reproducibles utilizando documentos Quarto. El taller utilizará un conjunto de datos disponible públicamente de los CDC, que contiene información sobre el uso de drogas y la ideación suicida entre adolescentes, como un ejemplo práctico del uso de R para la investigación académica en salud pública. Explicaremos cómo utilizar funciones como filtrar, mutar, resumir y seleccionar del conjunto de paquetes tidyverse. Concluiremos demostrando cómo usar ggplot2 para crear visualizaciones en R. Al final del taller, los participantes habrán creado un documento reproducible en formato HTML, detallando los pasos de limpieza de datos y el análisis de un problema social contemporáneo importante. Esta presentación tiene como objetivo cerrar la brecha en la alfabetización en programación entre los investigadores de habla hispana y promover métodos para la investigación científica reproducible.\n\n\n\n Catalina Cañizares can be found leading an R club focused on Public Health and Social work here, and creating many R teaching resources which can be found here.\nFrancisco Cardozo leads Machine Learning workshops across Latin America, which can be explored here, He is an active member of the ROpenSci community which can be found here, and also serves as a Software Carpentry instructor"

We also highly recommend that speakers take our online Inclusive Speaker Orientation Course.\nThe Chat\nR/Medicine has a strong tradition of active discussion in a virtual chat during virtual presentations, and this discussion is much better if the presenter or a co-presenter is active in the chat, sharing relevant links and answering questions during the presentation. If you are planning to be a solo presenter for a talk on Thursday or Friday, plan to prerecord your talk to submit by June 3, and to attend (virtually) in person to actively participate in the chat. If you have relevant links in your presentation, put them in a document ahead of time so that you can easily drop them into the chat when appropriate. If you have a co-presenter, decide who will present and who will chat (or take turns at a natural switching point).\nPanel submissions must include the names of all participants in the initial submission in order to be considered.  The Linux Foundation does not accept submissions with all-male panels, in an effort to increase speaker diversity.\nComplimentary Passes For Speakers: One complimentary pass for the event will be provided for the accepted primary speaker and a co-speaker. For panel sessions, each panelist will receive a complimentary pass. \nAvoid sales or marketing pitches and discussion of unlicensed or potentially closed-source technologies in your proposal. Talks of this nature are almost always rejected because they diminish the integrity of our events and are rarely well-received by conference attendees.\nAll accepted speakers are required to submit their presentation slides (and prerecorded presentation videos) by June 3, prior to the event.\nPoster sessions can be a static rectangular graphic, and can include a ‘share window’ where you can do short demos for folks who (virtually) walk up to your poster.\nPreparing to Submit Your Proposal\nWe do not intend to provide strict instructions on how to prepare your proposal; however, we hope you will review the following guidelines to help you prepare the best submission possible.  To get started, here are three questions you should consider before submitting your proposal:\n\nWhat are you hoping to get from your presentation?\nWhat do you expect the audience to gain from your presentation?\nHow will your presentation help better the R Medicine ecosystem?\n\nThere are many ways to give a presentation about projects and technologies without focusing on company-specific efforts.\nRemember the questions above when writing your proposal, and think of ways to make it interesting for attendees as you share your experiences, educate the community about a method or an issue, or generate interest in a project.\nFirst Time Submitting? Don’t Feel Intimidated\nLinux Foundation events are an excellent place for getting to know the community and sharing your ideas and the work you are doing.  We strongly encourage first-time speakers to submit talks for our events.  If you aren’t sure about your abstract, reach out to us and we will be happy to provide advice on your proposal.\nHow To Give a Great Tech Talk\nIf your talk is accepted, we want to help you give the best presentation possible.  To do this, we enlisted the assistance of seasoned conference speaker Josh Berkus, who has prepared this in-depth tutorial on “How to Give a Great Tech Talk”:\nPart 1: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE9y3gyF8Kw\nPart 2: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcOP4WQfJl4\nTo submit a proposal:\nFill out this form"
