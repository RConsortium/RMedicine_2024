    "text": "This page is intended for folks who have had their abstract accepted for a lightning talk or regular talk at R/Medicine 2024. Congratulations! We are excited to welcome you as a presenter. As a reminder, the event will take place virtually on Thursday and Friday, June 13-14, on Eastern Daylight Time. Please click through the tabs on this page to access information.\n\n\n\n\nPre-Recording Video Submission Due Date (mandatory for lightning talks, recommended for regular talks with only one speaker): Monday, June 3\nSpeaker Training (for all who will present live): TBD\nEvent Dates: Monday, June 10 – Friday, June 14\nTimezone: Eastern Daylight Time\n\n\n\n\n\nThe schedule has been posted on the R/Medicine web site.\nAll lightning talks are ten (10) minutes in total (including Q&A).\nAll regular talks are twenty (20) minutes in total (including Q&A).\n\n\n\n\nWe will be using the virtual platform Zoom that will allow speakers to deliver content live or by pre-recorded talk, and join the chat live (and drop links into the chat) for Q&A during the session.\nWorkshops and demos are best delivered live, though it can help to have a co-presenter monitoring the chat for questions.\nFor the main meeting on Thursday and Friday, it is best to have a presenter or co-presenter available for the live chat. This is one of the best features of R/Medicine, as the whole community gets to discuss the topic with the speaker during the talk without being rude. It really helps to have a co-presenter running the live chat, or to pre-record your talk so that you can participate in the live chat.\nIt is often helpful to prepare for the live chat by assembling a document with any links, references, etc. that you can copy and paste into the chat when appropriate.\n\n\n\n\nAll regular talk and lightning talk speakers may pre-record their talk, which will be played through the event platform. Speakers who will give a lightning talk must submit a pre-recorded talk.\nSome suggested tools to use for recording are Quicktime, Zoom, a screen recorder, or something similar. The recording should show your slides or screen and optionally yourself, using a picture in picture style format. Please share the actual video file, in MP4 format, not a link to a streaming service such as YouTube or Vimeo. Email this recording to us at info@r-consortium.org by midnight EDT on June 3.\nPlease feel free to reach out with any questions.\n\n\n\n\nAs with physical events, live interaction is essential to the success of virtual events and we are asking every presenter, whether presenting live or via pre-recorded session, to join for live chat with attendees during their session, within the platform. This will provide added value to the audience and create more of an ‘event’ experience.\nIf you are concerned about your timezone and how that could impact the live Q&A portion of your session, we will do our best to reschedule your session slot to a time that is convenient for you. Reach out to us if needed at r-medicine-conf@r-consortium.org\n\n\n\n\n\nAudio – as counterintuitive as it may sound, the single most important factor in a good video, is the audio quality.\nEliminate ambient noise – close the doors and windows. You’d be surprised how much environmental noise gets picked up.\nLighting – Do not put lights overhead and don’t put any lights or windows behind you as they will alter the light levels in your videos and create shadows.\nBackground – don’t be afraid to show your natural environment – bookcases, plants, paintings – as long as they are not too distracting.\nFraming – place yourself slightly off-center to the left or right rather than directly in the middle of the frame.\nCamera Height – the lens should either be directly level or pointing ever so slightly downwards towards your face.\nStand – we recommend you stand during your presentation to help project your voice and improve your posture. However, if you’re more comfortable sitting, then please do.\nTimer – Have a clock to keep track of the time you have remaining.\n\nFrom: https://www.greatspeech.co/video-presentations/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor best results, use natural light and supplement with additional light as needed.\nKeep natural light in front of you to avoid shadows. A bright window behind you can make you appear as a dark silhouette.\nInterior rooms with no natural light source may require additional targeted lighting, such as a ring light, to brighten the speaker’s face.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo ensure the speaker is looking directly at the audience, place the webcam at eye level.\nAvoid distracting backgrounds by checking the surroundings behind you to make sure there are no distracting colors or movement.\nPresenters should use chairs that are adjustable for height but do not swivel. Swiveling on camera creates a poor attendee experience and can be distracting.\n\n\n\n\n\nUse external microphones whenever available, as microphones built into computers and cameras often have lower quality.\nAn external microphone allows the speaker to place it in the optimal location for sound.\nPlace the microphone close to the speaker’s mouth, but not in the camera view.\nTest audio levels in advance.\nManage noise by turning off fans, phones, or speakers and keep ambient noise to a minimum.\nDo not touch the microphone while unmuted\n\n\n\n\nThere is no dress code for presentations, and we encourage you to be comfortable. That said, you must be aware that the Code of Conduct applies to this space, both in terms of what you show on camera and what you say. We ask that you be tasteful and considerate in choosing your clothing and surroundings. Keep in mind that we are a global community. Please refrain from wearing shirts with global brand logos that are not your own. Solid colors (not white) also work best instead of prints.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn the Content: Familiarity with the content allows a speaker to focus on presenting, rather than trying to remember the points to make. To minimize worry about forgetting elements of the presentation, include notes in your presentation file and have a prepared e-document of your links, script, or talking points that you can paste into the chat.\nPractice Makes Perfect: Speakers should practice their content delivery in the environment in which they will deliver it, such as in front of a computer. Presenting alone to a computer can be awkward at first. To make speakers more comfortable, ask colleagues, roommates, or family to sit in front so they can present to familiar faces.\nUnderstand the Tools: Speakers should understand and utilize the content options available to them, to maximize the effectiveness of the presentation technology. It’s important to know the basic functions of the software, e.g. how to advance slides, manage Zoom Q&A or chats, before the presentation.\nSpeak Up: Check audio levels before presenting, but also make sure to breathe at regular intervals to speak audibly and clearly. Maintaining a clear, even tone throughout the presentation will allow the audience to hear it without adjusting their volume settings.\nLook at Your Camera: If presenting via video, remember, the webcam is your link to your audience. Make eye contact with the camera so it appears to the audience that you are speaking directly to them.\nDon’t Fear Mistakes: Humans make mistakes, even during presentations. Realize that flubs happen and they won’t derail your presentation – unless you let them. Just keep going in your planned presentation and remember, the audience is forgiving.\nBe Prepared: During the presentation, have a glass of water nearby to sip as needed. Also, keep handy a printout of your slides or notes in case you need to refer to them.\n\nFrom: https://www.inxpo.com/assets/pdfs/litepapers/How-To-Be-An-Engaging-Speaker.pdf\n\n\n\n\nThe Linux Foundation, in collaboration with the National Center for Women in Technology (NCWIT), has created an online course designed to teach the viewer about inclusion, diversity, and unconscious bias. We highly recommend all of our speakers, watch the course to learn tips/tools to use when speaking to encourage inclusivity in presentations and messaging.\n\n\n\n\nPlease read and abide by our code of conduct, which can be found here. We ask that speakers especially review this code of conduct and are inclusive in the words and images used during their presentation.\n\n\n\n\nBest Gear for Online Meetings – Webcams, lights, mics, tripods and more\n19 Video Presentation Tips to help you give a great presentation (even if you hate the way you look on camera)\n9 Tips for Giving Engaging Virtual Presentations – This article gives 9 tips and within each tip has folks from the tech world giving their advice in a fun/relatable way.\nPACE Acronym for Virtual Presentations\nChecklist for Speakers – this article provides checklists applicable for speakers that are live streaming.\n\n\n\n\nIf you have any other platform, speaker, or schedule-related questions, please contact us at r-medicine-conf@r-consortium.org."

REDCap is an electronic data capture software that is widely used in the medical research community. The REDCapR package streamlines calls to the REDCap API from an R environment. One of REDCapR’s main uses is to import records from a REDCap project. This works well for simple projects, however this workflow becomes fugly when complex databases that include longitudinal structure and/or repeating instruments are used.\nThe REDCapTidieR package aims to make the life of analysts who deal with complex REDCap databases easier. It builds upon REDCapR to make its output tidier. Instead of one large data frame that contains all the data from your project, you get to work with a set of tidy tibbles, one for each REDCap instrument.\n\n\n\nStephan can be found automating everything at CHOP, on Twitter at @StephanKadauke, and promoting reproducible medical research with R.\nWill can be found working on improving REDCap Workflows, and supporting a variety of research studies at OUHSC.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nCatalina Cañizares is a passionate data scientist and a Ph.D. candidate in Social Welfare, dedicated to using data to gain insights into emotional disorders.

Francisco siente pasión por traducir hallazgos científicos en aplicaciones prácticas.\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite the abundant resources available for learning R, most of these materials are primarily accessible to English speakers. This language barrier significantly restricts access for individuals who do not speak English proficiently. As a result, Spanish-speaking communities often face considerable challenges in accessing software training opportunities. This disparity leads to inequities in the distribution and utilization of scientific technologies, which is particularly concerning given the increasing importance of digital skills nowadays. To mitigate these challenges and promote inclusivity, we propose conducting a programming workshop in Spanish during the conference. This initiative aims to bridge the gap by providing Spanish-speaking participants with equal opportunities to engage with and benefit from technological advancements. By doing so, we not only enhance individual capabilities but also contribute to a more equitable distribution of educational resources in the scientific community. This workshop will equip attendees with basic skills in R. Our primary objective is to familiarize participants with RStudio and its key features for generating reproducible reports. We will guide attendees through the process of creating and managing projects in RStudio and introduce them to creating reproducible manuscripts using Quarto documents. The workshop will utilize a publicly available dataset from the CDC, which contains information on drug use and suicidal ideation among adolescents, as a practical example of using R for academic research in public health. We will explain how to use functions such as filter, mutate, summarize, and select from the tidyverse suite of packages. We will conclude by demonstrating how to use ggplot2 to create visualizations in R. By the end of the workshop, participants will have created a, reproducible document in HTML format, detailing the data cleaning steps and analysis of a significant, contemporary social issue. This presentation aims to close the gap in programming literacy among Spanish-speaking researchers and promote methods for reproducible scientific inquiry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA pesar de los abundantes recursos disponibles para aprender R, la mayoría de estos materiales son accesibles principalmente para angloparlantes. Esta barrera del idioma restringe significativamente el acceso de personas que no hablan inglés con fluidez. Como resultado, las comunidades de habla hispana a menudo enfrentan desafíos considerables para acceder a oportunidades de capacitación en software. Esta disparidad conduce a desigualdades en la distribución y utilización de las tecnologías científicas, lo que es particularmente preocupante dada la creciente importancia de las habilidades digitales en la actualidad. Para mitigar estos desafíos y promover la inclusión, proponemos realizar un taller de programación en español durante la conferencia. Esta iniciativa tiene como objetivo cerrar la brecha brindando a los participantes de habla hispana igualdad de oportunidades para interactuar y beneficiarse de los avances tecnológicos. Al hacerlo, no sólo mejoramos las capacidades individuales sino que también contribuimos a una distribución más equitativa de los recursos educativos en la comunidad científica. Este taller equipará a los asistentes con habilidades básicas en R. Nuestro objetivo principal es familiarizar a los participantes con RStudio y sus características clave para generar informes reproducibles. Guiaremos a los asistentes a través del proceso de creación y gestión de proyectos en RStudio y les presentaremos la creación de manuscritos reproducibles utilizando documentos Quarto. El taller utilizará un conjunto de datos disponible públicamente de los CDC, que contiene información sobre el uso de drogas y la ideación suicida entre adolescentes, como un ejemplo práctico del uso de R para la investigación académica en salud pública. Explicaremos cómo utilizar funciones como filtrar, mutar, resumir y seleccionar del conjunto de paquetes tidyverse. Concluiremos demostrando cómo usar ggplot2 para crear visualizaciones en R. Al final del taller, los participantes habrán creado un documento reproducible en formato HTML, detallando los pasos de limpieza de datos y el análisis de un problema social contemporáneo importante. Esta presentación tiene como objetivo cerrar la brecha en la alfabetización en programación entre los investigadores de habla hispana y promover métodos para la investigación científica reproducible.\n\n\n\n Catalina Cañizares can be found leading an R club focused on Public Health and Social work here, and creating many R teaching resources which can be found here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShannon Pileggi is a former statistics college professor now working in industry.

Attendees will learn about commonly seen time series patterns, and how to find them with specialised time series graphics created with ggplot2. Then we will use fable to capture these patterns with statistical time series models, and produce probabilistic forecasts. Finally, participants will learn how to evaluate model performance, using accuracy statistics to choose the model which produces the most accurate forecasts. With a combination of foundational concepts and practical demonstrations, this workshop equips participants with the skills to extract meaning from time series data for informed decision-making in various domains.\n\n\n\nMitchell is a Monash University PhD candidate with passions for time series data and data-driven permaculture.

This language barrier significantly restricts access for individuals who do not speak English proficiently. As a result, Spanish-speaking communities often face considerable challenges in accessing software training opportunities. This disparity leads to inequities in the distribution and utilization of scientific technologies, which is particularly concerning given the increasing importance of digital skills nowadays. To mitigate these challenges and promote inclusivity, we propose conducting a programming workshop in Spanish during the conference. This initiative aims to bridge the gap by providing Spanish-speaking participants with equal opportunities to engage with and benefit from technological advancements. By doing so, we not only enhance individual capabilities but also contribute to a more equitable distribution of educational resources in the scientific community. This workshop will equip attendees with basic skills in R. Our primary objective is to familiarize participants with RStudio and its key features for generating reproducible reports. We will guide attendees through the process of creating and managing projects in RStudio and introduce them to creating reproducible manuscripts using Quarto documents. The workshop will utilize a publicly available dataset from the CDC, which contains information on drug use and suicidal ideation among adolescents, as a practical example of using R for academic research in public health. We will explain how to use functions such as filter, mutate, summarize, and select from the tidyverse suite of packages. We will conclude by demonstrating how to use ggplot2 to create visualizations in R. By the end of the workshop, participants will have created a, reproducible document in HTML format, detailing the data cleaning steps and analysis of a significant, contemporary social issue. This presentation aims to close the gap in programming literacy among Spanish-speaking researchers and promote methods for reproducible scientific inquiry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA pesar de los abundantes recursos disponibles para aprender R, la mayoría de estos materiales son accesibles principalmente para angloparlantes.

    "text": "How can we optimize medication treatments for opioid use disorder?\nWhich individuals are more at risk of dropping out of a treatment program?\nWhich individuals are more at risk of relapsing?\n\nThe R/Medicine planning committee welcomes your participation in the virtual R/Medicine data challenge. Participants will have from now until May 21st, 2024 to work on submissions for the challenge. There will be 3 prizes: one for overall quality of analyses/Quarto docs, as well as prizes for best table and best visualization.\nIt is well known that opioid use disorder is currently a major public health concern that has significant implications for the entire healthcare system. Understanding more about how we can best develop effective treatment programs is needed now more than ever as we continue to combat the opioid epidemic.\n\n\nIn this data challenge, you will analyze various factors that may contribute to either treatment success or treatment failure for opioid use disorder using harmonized data collected from three multi-site clinical trials from the CTN. We encourage you to read more about how this data was collected here.\nWe ask that all analyses be done and submitted as Quarto documents. Participants can submit as an individual or as part of a team (but not both). The maximum team size is 3. Your goal will be to transform these datasets into actionable indicators that illustrate which factors are important to understanding why some patients achieve success with treatment for opioid use disorder and why others drop out or relapse.\nThe data for this challenge is available on CRAN.The following 2 code chunks demonstrate how to install and load the necessary packages. You can read more about the packages on CRAN here and here.\n\ninstall.packages(\"public.ctn0094data\")\ninstall.packages(\"public.ctn0094extra\")\n\n\nlibrary(public.ctn0094data)\nlibrary(public.ctn0094extra)\n\nIn addition to the provided data, you may request to use additional publicly available data in your submission by submitting a request by May 1st, 2024 at 5:00PM EST. If approved, the data will be made available to all participants.\nYou will be evaluated by judges based on the relevance, completeness, and quality of your submission. Remember that tables and visualizations will also be judged and ranked separately for the prizes of best table and best visualization. Judges include:\nRaymond Balise, PhD, University of Miami\nPeter Higgins, MD, PhD, MSc, University of Michigan\nBryan P.

Updates will be posted on this website.\nWho you are: We welcome any participants over age 18, especially undergraduate students, graduate students, and early professional data scientists and biostatisticians. Analysts based in academic institutions, government statistical offices, think tanks, policy labs, and community organizations are encouraged to participate.\nWhat topics you can explore: Participants can analyze the included opioid use disorder data in tandem with with any other related publicly available data submitted for approval before May 1st, 2024.\nSubmissions and evaluation: Participants will conduct their analyses and submit a short project narrative that describes the research question, analytic approach, and key findings. We encourage participants to find creative ways to incorporate tables, visualizations, and other aspects of data storytelling to create a compelling narrative. In addition to their completed analysis with the indicators they used, participants will be asked to submit documentation describing each step of their process. The documentation should be detailed enough as to make the project fully replicable. The narrative, methods, organization, and documentation of each participant’s project will be evaluated for relevance, completeness, and quality.

However, single-cell data present unique challenges that have required the development of specialized methods and software infrastructure to successfully derive biological insights. Compared to bulk RNA-seq, there is an increased scale of the number of observations (or cells) that are measured and there is increased sparsity of the data, or fraction of observed zeros. Furthermore, as single-cell technologies mature, the increasing complexity and volume of data require fundamental changes in data access, management, and infrastructure alongside specialized methods to facilitate scalable analyses. I will discuss some challenges in the analysis of scRNA-seq and spatially-resolved transcriptomics data and present some solutions that we have made towards addressing these challenges.\n\n\nBiography\n\nDr. Stephanie Hicks is an Associate Professor in the Department of Biomedical Engineering and Biostatistics at Johns Hopkins University where she has affiliations with the Malone Center for Engineering in Healthcare, Center for Computational Biology, the Department of Genetic Medicine, and the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. She is an expert in developing scalable computational methods and open-source software for biomedical data analysis, in particular single-cell and spatial transcriptomics genomics data, leading to an improved understanding of human health and disease. She serves on a variety of boards including the Bioconductor Technical Advisory Board, and the Editorial Board at Genome Biology and the Journal of American Statistical Association. Locally, she co-founded and co-organizes the R-Ladies Baltimore chapter to promote gender diversity in the R programming language community. She is a recipient of several professional awards including a K99/R00 Pathway to Independence Award, a High-Impact Project Award from the Bloomberg American Health Initiative, Teaching in the Health Sciences Young Investigator Award from the American Statistical Association (ASA), Harvard University’s Myrto Lefkopoulou Award for excellence in Biostatistics, and the COPSS Emerging Leader Award from the ASA, arguably the statistical profession’s most prestigious award for early career leaders in Statistics and Data Science.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGundula Bosch\nReproducibility in Biomedical Research Education \nFriday, June 14\n\n\nAbstract\nOur approach to building graduate and post—graduate level research capacity in living the 3R’s of good science, Rigor, Reproducibility, and Responsibility, starts in the classroom and extends throughout laboratory practice. The central idea behind our “R3” program is to implement elements of the humanities, particularly philosophy and communication science, in the research and mentoring experiences we create for our learners. This concept stems from the realization that the first principles of science can be formally taught, by relying not on rote-learning of subject matter, but rather emphasizing critically-integrative thinking and translation across disciplines. To that end, we are teaching a research-reality applied form of epistemology, logic , ethics, methods, and scientific communication.\nThis presentation will focus on a particular aspect of our program, namely the integration of R3 education, specifically reproducibility, into statistical reasoning training for the life-sciences, from the laboratory to basic data science applications. The R3 program accompanies trainees in biomedicine throughout their graduate and post-graduate, continuing education: We begin with communications-embedded, fundamental skills in biostatistical logic; continue with techniques to make biomedical data ready for AI and ML applications and collaborations; and provide skills how to make sense of big data in biomedicine, particularly for science practitioners with limited experience on the data science field.\nThis talk will illustrate our educational practice by reflecting on successes and challenges, and providing ideas for enhancing networks and partnerships in the global graduate science education landscape.\n\n\nBiography\n\nGundula Bosch, PhD, MEd ’16, MS, is a scientist and educator leading global education reform through training programs in critical, broad, and interdisciplinary scientific thinking. She is the director of the R3 Center for Innovation and Science Education at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health.\nAs an interdisciplinary scientist with joint appointments at the Johns Hopkins Schools of Public Health and Education, Dr. Bosch’s research focus lies in implementation science and the development of valid metrics to assess outcomes and impact of interventions in graduate science and health education, nationally and globally. In her function as the Director of the R3 Center for Innovation in Science Education (R3ISE) at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Dr. Bosch developed and leads the R3 Graduate Science Programs (PMID: 29259084; PMID: 29446388) that stand for “the three R’s” of good scientific practice: Rigor in research conduct, Reproducibility of results, and Responsibility of scientists to society. Originally from Munich, Germany, she holds a Ph.D. in Biology from the Max-Planck-Institute of Biochemistry and a master’s degree in Education from Johns Hopkins.\nUnder Dr. Bosch’s leadership, the R3ISE team offers graduate-level programs that bring formal training in critical thinking, quantitative reasoning, sound research methodology, interdisciplinary collaboration, ethical decision-making, responsible communication, and social justice into graduate student training in biomedicine, public health, engineering, and technology (PMID: 35570294; PMID: 37289659). Through the global R3ISEnetwork of scientist-educators, these training experiences are available to all graduate and post-graduate trainees at Johns Hopkins, as well as national and international partner institutions."

We also highly recommend that speakers take our online Inclusive Speaker Orientation Course.\nThe Chat\nR/Medicine has a strong tradition of active discussion in a virtual chat during virtual presentations, and this discussion is much better if the presenter or a co-presenter is active in the chat, sharing relevant links and answering questions during the presentation. If you are planning to be a solo presenter for a talk on Thursday or Friday, plan to prerecord your talk to submit by June 3, and to attend (virtually) in person to actively participate in the chat. If you have relevant links in your presentation, put them in a document ahead of time so that you can easily drop them into the chat when appropriate. If you have a co-presenter, decide who will present and who will chat (or take turns at a natural switching point).\nPanel submissions must include the names of all participants in the initial submission in order to be considered.  The Linux Foundation does not accept submissions with all-male panels, in an effort to increase speaker diversity.\nComplimentary Passes For Speakers: One complimentary pass for the event will be provided for the accepted primary speaker and a co-speaker. For panel sessions, each panelist will receive a complimentary pass. \nAvoid sales or marketing pitches and discussion of unlicensed or potentially closed-source technologies in your proposal. Talks of this nature are almost always rejected because they diminish the integrity of our events and are rarely well-received by conference attendees.\nAll accepted speakers are required to submit their presentation slides (and prerecorded presentation videos) by June 3, prior to the event.\nPoster sessions can be a static rectangular graphic, and can include a ‘share window’ where you can do short demos for folks who (virtually) walk up to your poster.\nPreparing to Submit Your Proposal\nWe do not intend to provide strict instructions on how to prepare your proposal; however, we hope you will review the following guidelines to help you prepare the best submission possible.  To get started, here are three questions you should consider before submitting your proposal:\n\nWhat are you hoping to get from your presentation?\nWhat do you expect the audience to gain from your presentation?\nHow will your presentation help better the R Medicine ecosystem?\n\nThere are many ways to give a presentation about projects and technologies without focusing on company-specific efforts.\nRemember the questions above when writing your proposal, and think of ways to make it interesting for attendees as you share your experiences, educate the community about a method or an issue, or generate interest in a project.\nFirst Time Submitting? Don’t Feel Intimidated\nLinux Foundation events are an excellent place for getting to know the community and sharing your ideas and the work you are doing.  We strongly encourage first-time speakers to submit talks for our events.  If you aren’t sure about your abstract, reach out to us and we will be happy to provide advice on your proposal.\nHow To Give a Great Tech Talk\nIf your talk is accepted, we want to help you give the best presentation possible.  To do this, we have listed two videos on how to give a great tech talk:\nYour Perfect Tech Talk: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzVr_nsKoZs\nA general MIT lecture on How to Speak: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Unzc731iCUY\nTo submit a proposal:\nFill out this form"

Talks of this nature are almost always rejected because they diminish the integrity of our events and are rarely well-received by conference attendees.\nAll accepted speakers are required to submit their presentation slides (and prerecorded presentation videos) by June 3, prior to the event.\nPoster sessions can be a static rectangular graphic, and can include a ‘share window’ where you can do short demos for folks who (virtually) walk up to your poster.\nPreparing to Submit Your Proposal\nWe do not intend to provide strict instructions on how to prepare your proposal; however, we hope you will review the following guidelines to help you prepare the best submission possible.  To get started, here are three questions you should consider before submitting your proposal:\n\nWhat are you hoping to get from your presentation?\nWhat do you expect the audience to gain from your presentation?\nHow will your presentation help better the R Medicine ecosystem?\n\nThere are many ways to give a presentation about projects and technologies without focusing on company-specific efforts.\nRemember the questions above when writing your proposal, and think of ways to make it interesting for attendees as you share your experiences, educate the community about a method or an issue, or generate interest in a project.\nFirst Time Submitting? Don’t Feel Intimidated\nLinux Foundation events are an excellent place for getting to know the community and sharing your ideas and the work you are doing.  We strongly encourage first-time speakers to submit talks for our events.  If you aren’t sure about your abstract, reach out to us and we will be happy to provide advice on your proposal.\nHow To Give a Great Tech Talk\nIf your talk is accepted, we want to help you give the best presentation possible.  To do this, we have listed two videos on how to give a great tech talk:\nYour Perfect Tech Talk: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzVr_nsKoZs\nA general MIT lecture on How to Speak: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Unzc731iCUY\nTo submit a proposal:\nFill out this form"
