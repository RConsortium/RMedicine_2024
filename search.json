We’ll cover stylish and convenient dashboard layouts and components as we showcase the ways in which bslib can replace shinydashboard. We’ll also learn about exciting new ways to deploy Shiny apps with shinylive as static sites that run entirely in the user’s browser and don’t require setting up or maintaining a Shiny server.\n\n\n\nGarrick can be found blogging at garrickadenbuie.com, on Mastodon @grrrck@fosstodon.org, and sticking things together with epoxy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStephan Kadauke is the Assistant Director of the Cell and Gene Therapy Laboratory at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.

At CHOP, he is responsible for the development and implementation of new technologies including CAR-T therapy in the Cell and Gene Therapy Laboratory.\n\nWill Beasley is a Professor of Pediatrics and leads the Clinical Research Data Warehouse at the Oklahoma University Health Sciences Center. He received his PhD in quantitative psychology from University of Oklahoma. In addition to his role in BBMC and the CRDW, he provides statistical analysis and software development to research studies at OUHSC. Dr. Beasley’s areas of expertise and interest include Bayesian and Frequentist statistics, bioinformatics, simulation methods, and exploratory and graphical analysis, and reproducible research. He also has a wealth of software programming experience including SQL Server, C#, and R.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis workshop will use the {REDCap Tidier} package to get clinical data out of REDCap and prepare it for analysis. REDCap is an electronic data capture software that is widely used in the medical research community. The REDCapR package streamlines calls to the REDCap API from an R environment. One of REDCapR’s main uses is to import records from a REDCap project. This works well for simple projects, however this workflow becomes fugly when complex databases that include longitudinal structure and/or repeating instruments are used.\nThe REDCapTidieR package aims to make the life of analysts who deal with complex REDCap databases easier. It builds upon REDCapR to make its output tidier. Instead of one large data frame that contains all the data from your project, you get to work with a set of tidy tibbles, one for each REDCap instrument.\n\n\n\nStephan can be found automating everything at CHOP, on Twitter at @StephanKadauke, and promoting reproducible medical research with R.\nWill can be found working on improving REDCap Workflows, and supporting a variety of research studies at OUHSC."

Can include live (virtual) demos of an app or a package.\n\nAn abstract proposal should describe a presentation of methodology, a study or project, or an example or case study relevant to one (or more) of our fields of interest, with R-based tools having a substantial role in the work.  The content of the presentation should be of interest to the R/Medicine community.\nDates to Remember\nCFP Closes:  Monday, April 22 at 11:59 PM EDT\nCFP Notifications:  April 29\nSchedule Announcement:  May 6\nPre-Recorded Video Submission:  June 3\nR/Medicine 2024 Conference:  Monday, June 10  to  Friday, June 14\nImportant Notes\nAll speakers are required to adhere to our Code of Conduct. We also highly recommend that speakers take our online Inclusive Speaker Orientation Course.\nThe Chat\nR/Medicine has a strong tradition of active discussion in a virtual chat during virtual presentations, and this discussion is much better if the presenter or a co-presenter is active in the chat, sharing relevant links and answering questions during the presentation. If you are planning to be a solo presenter for a talk on Thursday or Friday, plan to prerecord your talk to submit by June 3, and to attend (virtually) in person to actively participate in the chat. If you have relevant links in your presentation, put them in a document ahead of time so that you can easily drop them into the chat when appropriate. If you have a co-presenter, decide who will present and who will chat (or take turns at a natural switching point).\nPanel submissions must include the names of all participants in the initial submission in order to be considered.  The Linux Foundation does not accept submissions with all-male panels, in an effort to increase speaker diversity.\nComplimentary Passes For Speakers: One complimentary pass for the event will be provided for the accepted primary speaker and a co-speaker. For panel sessions, each panelist will receive a complimentary pass. \nAvoid sales or marketing pitches and discussion of unlicensed or potentially closed-source technologies in your proposal. Talks of this nature are almost always rejected because they diminish the integrity of our events and are rarely well-received by conference attendees.\nAll accepted speakers are required to submit their presentation slides (and prerecorded presentation videos) by June 3, prior to the event.\nPoster sessions can be a static rectangular graphic, and can include a ‘share window’ where you can do short demos for folks who (virtually) walk up to your poster.\nPreparing to Submit Your Proposal\nWe do not intend to provide strict instructions on how to prepare your proposal; however, we hope you will review the following guidelines to help you prepare the best submission possible.  To get started, here are three questions you should consider before submitting your proposal:\n\nWhat are you hoping to get from your presentation?\nWhat do you expect the audience to gain from your presentation?\nHow will your presentation help better the R Medicine ecosystem?\n\nThere are many ways to give a presentation about projects and technologies without focusing on company-specific efforts.\nRemember the questions above when writing your proposal, and think of ways to make it interesting for attendees as you share your experiences, educate the community about a method or an issue, or generate interest in a project.\nFirst Time Submitting? Don’t Feel Intimidated\nLinux Foundation events are an excellent place for getting to know the community and sharing your ideas and the work you are doing.  We strongly encourage first-time speakers to submit talks for our events.  If you aren’t sure about your abstract, reach out to us and we will be happy to provide advice on your proposal.\nHow To Give a Great Tech Talk\nIf your talk is accepted, we want to help you give the best presentation possible.  To do this, we enlisted the assistance of seasoned conference speaker Josh Berkus, who has prepared this in-depth tutorial on “How to Give a Great Tech Talk”:\nPart 1: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE9y3gyF8Kw\nPart 2: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcOP4WQfJl4\nTo submit a proposal:\nFill out this form"
