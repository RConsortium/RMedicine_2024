            The R/Medicine conference provides a forum for sharing R based tools
            and approaches used to analyze and gain insights from health data.
            Conference workshops provide a way to learn and develop your R
            skills. Midweek demos allow you to try out new R packages and tools,
            and our hackathon provides an opportunity to learn how to develop
            new R tools. The conference talks share new packages, and successes
            in analyzing health, laboratory, and clinical data with R and Shiny
            with a vigorous ongoing discussion with speakers (with pre-recorded
            talks) in the chat.

                    Single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-seq) is the most widely used
                    high-throughput technology to measure genome-wide gene
                    expression at the single-cell level. However, single-cell
                    data present unique challenges that have required the
                    development of specialized methods and software
                    infrastructure to successfully derive biological insights.
                    Compared to bulk RNA-seq, there is an increased scale of the
                    number of observations (or cells) that are measured and
                    there is increased sparsity of the data, or fraction of
                    observed zeros. Furthermore, as single-cell technologies
                    mature, the increasing complexity and volume of data require
                    fundamental changes in data access, management, and
                    infrastructure alongside specialized methods to facilitate
                    scalable analyses. I will discuss some challenges in the
                    analysis of scRNA-seq and spatially-resolved transcriptomics
                    data and present some solutions that we have made towards
                    addressing these challenges.

                    Dr.&nbsp;Stephanie Hicks is an Associate Professor in the
                    Department of Biomedical Engineering and Biostatistics at
                    Johns Hopkins University where she has affiliations with the
                    Malone Center for Engineering in Healthcare, Center for
                    Computational Biology, the Department of Genetic Medicine,
                    and the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.
                    She is an expert in developing scalable computational
                    methods and open-source software for biomedical data
                    analysis, in particular single-cell and spatial
                    transcriptomics genomics data, leading to an improved
                    understanding of human health and disease. She serves on a
                    variety of boards including the Bioconductor Technical
                    Advisory Board, and the Editorial Board at Genome Biology
                    and the Journal of American Statistical Association.
                    Locally, she co-founded and co-organizes the R-Ladies
                    Baltimore chapter to promote gender diversity in the R
                    programming language community. She is a recipient of
                    several professional awards including a K99/R00 Pathway to
                    Independence Award, a High-Impact Project Award from the
                    Bloomberg American Health Initiative, Teaching in the Health
                    Sciences Young Investigator Award from the American
                    Statistical Association (ASA), Harvard University’s Myrto
                    Lefkopoulou Award for excellence in Biostatistics, and the
                    COPSS Emerging Leader Award from the ASA, arguably the
                    statistical profession’s most prestigious award for early
                    career leaders in Statistics and Data Science.

                    Our approach to building graduate and post—graduate level
                    research capacity in living the 3R’s of good science, Rigor,
                    Reproducibility, and Responsibility, starts in the classroom
                    and extends throughout laboratory practice. The central idea
                    behind our “R3” program is to implement elements of the
                    humanities, particularly philosophy and communication
                    science, in the research and mentoring experiences we create
                    for our learners. This concept stems from the realization
                    that the first principles of science can be formally taught,
                    by relying not on rote-learning of subject matter, but
                    rather emphasizing critically-integrative thinking and
                    translation across disciplines. To that end, we are teaching
                    a research-reality applied form of epistemology, logic ,
                    ethics, methods, and scientific communication.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This presentation will focus on a particular aspect of our
                    program, namely the integration of R3 education,
                    specifically reproducibility, into statistical reasoning
                    training for the life-sciences, from the laboratory to basic
                    data science applications. The R3 program accompanies
                    trainees in biomedicine throughout their graduate and
                    post-graduate, continuing education: We begin with
                    communications-embedded, fundamental skills in
                    biostatistical logic; continue with techniques to make
                    biomedical data ready for AI and ML applications and
                    collaborations; and provide skills how to make sense of big
                    data in biomedicine, particularly for science practitioners
                    with limited experience on the data science field.
                  </p>

                    This talk will illustrate our educational practice by
                    reflecting on successes and challenges, and providing ideas
                    for enhancing networks and partnerships in the global
                    graduate science education landscape.

                    <p>
                      Gundula Bosch, PhD, MEd ’16, MS, is a scientist and
                      educator leading global education reform through training
                      programs in critical, broad, and interdisciplinary
                      scientific thinking. She is the director of the R3 Center
                      for Innovation and Science Education at the Johns Hopkins
                      School of Public Health.
                    </p>
                    As an interdisciplinary scientist with joint appointments at
                    the Johns Hopkins Schools of Public Health and Education,
                    Dr.&nbsp;Bosch’s research focus lies in implementation
                    science and the development of valid metrics to assess
                    outcomes and impact of interventions in graduate science and
                    health education, nationally and globally. In her function
                    as the Director of the R3 Center for Innovation in Science
                    Education (R3ISE) at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of
                    Public Health, Dr.&nbsp;Bosch developed and leads the R3
                    Graduate Science Programs (PMID: 29259084; PMID: 29446388)
                    that stand for “the three R’s” of good scientific practice:
                    Rigor in research conduct, Reproducibility of results, and
                    Responsibility of scientists to society. Originally from
                    Munich, Germany, she holds a Ph.D.&nbsp;in Biology from the
                    Max-Planck-Institute of Biochemistry and a master’s degree
                    in Education from Johns Hopkins.<br />
                    Under Dr.&nbsp;Bosch’s leadership, the R3ISE team offers
                    graduate-level programs that bring formal training in
                    critical thinking, quantitative reasoning, sound research
                    methodology, interdisciplinary collaboration, ethical
                    decision-making, responsible communication, and social
                    justice into graduate student training in biomedicine,
                    public health, engineering, and technology (PMID: 35570294;
                    PMID: 37289659). Through the global R3ISEnetwork of
                    scientist-educators, these training experiences are
                    available to all graduate and post-graduate trainees at
                    Johns Hopkins, as well as national and international partner
                    institutions.
