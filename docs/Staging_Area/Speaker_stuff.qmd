 Workshops


### Lucy D'Agostino McGowan and Malcolm Barrett

Causal Inference with R 
Monday June 10th 
from 11AM-2PM eastern time

mcgowald@wfu.edu
malcolmbarrett@gmail.com

n three hours, we could likely cover something like:
* A quick overview of performing a causal analysis
* DAGs in R
* Propensity scores
* Sensitivity analyses

In the past, we have used the NHANES Epidemiologic Follow-up Study (NHEFS) data as a primary example -- does this sound ok for your audience?
