            Code of Conduct
          </h2>
          <p>
            The R Consortium and its working groups are dedicated to providing a
            harassment-free experience for participants at all of our events,
            whether they are held in person or virtually. R Consortium events
            are working conferences intended for professional networking and
            collaboration within the open source community. They exist to
            encourage the open exchange of ideas and expression and require an
            environment that recognizes the inherent worth of every person and
            group. While at R Consortium events or related ancillary or social
            events, any participants, including members, speakers, attendees,
            volunteers, sponsors, exhibitors, booth staff and anyone else,
            should not engage in harassment in any form.
          </p>
          <p>
            This Code of Conduct may be revised at any time by The R Consortium
            and the terms are non-negotiable. Your registration for or
            attendance at any R Consortium event, whether it’s held in person or
            virtually, indicates your agreement to abide by this policy and its
            terms.

              Expected Behavior
            </h3>
            <p>
              All event participants, whether they are attending an in-person
              event or a virtual event, are expected to behave in accordance
              with professional standards, with both this Code of Conduct as
              well as their respective employer’s policies governing appropriate
              workplace behavior and applicable laws.

            <p>
              Harassment will not be tolerated in any form, whether in person or
              virtually, including, but not limited to, harassment based on sex,
              gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body
              size, race, age, religion or any other status protected by laws in
              which the conference or program is being held. Harassment includes
              the use of abusive, offensive or degrading language, intimidation,
              stalking, harassing photography or recording, inappropriate
              physical contact, sexual imagery and unwelcome sexual advances or
              requests for sexual favors. Any report of harassment at one of our
              events, whether in person or virtual, will be addressed
              immediately. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are
              expected to comply immediately. Anyone who witnesses or is
              subjected to unacceptable behavior should notify a conference
              organizer at once.
            </p>
            <p>
              Exhibitors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other
              material in their booths and must refrain from the use of
              sexualized clothing, uniforms, costumes, or otherwise creating a
              sexualized environment. Speakers should not use sexual language,
              images, or any language or images that would constitute harassment
              as defined above in their talks.
            </p>

              Individuals who participate (or plan to participate) in R
              Consortium events, whether its an in-person event or a virtual
              event, should conduct themselves at all times in a manner that
              comports with both the letter and spirit of this policy
              prohibiting harassment and abusive behavior, whether before,
              during or after the event.&nbsp; This includes statements made in
              social media postings, on-line publications, text messages, and
              all other forms of electronic communication.

              If a participant engages in harassing behavior, whether in person
              or virtually, the conference organizers may take any action they
              deem appropriate depending on the circumstances, ranging from
              issuance of a warning to the offending individual to expulsion
              from the conference with no refund. The R Consortium reserves the
              right to exclude any participant found to be engaging in harassing
              behavior from participating in any further R Consortium events,
              working groups, trainings or other activities.
            </p>
            <p>
              If a participant (or individual wishing to participate in an R
              Consortium event, in-person and/or virtual), through postings on
              social media or other online publications or another form of
              electronic communication, engages in conduct that violates this
              policy, whether before, during or after a R Consortium&nbsp;
              event, the R Consortium&nbsp; may take appropriate corrective
              action, which could include imposing a temporary or permanent ban
              on an individual’s participation in future R Consortium events,
              events, working groups, trainings or other activities.

              Our staff has taken incident response training and responds to
              harassment reports quickly and thoroughly. As referenced above, if
              a participant engages in harassing behavior, whether in-person or
              virtually, the conference organizers may take any action they deem
              appropriate, ranging from issuance of a warning to the offending
              individual to expulsion from the conference with no refund,
              depending on the circumstances. The R Consortium reserves the
              right to exclude any participant found to be engaging in harassing
              behavior from participating in any further R Consortium events,
              working groups, trainings or other activities.
            </p>

              or virtually and have concerns regarding another individual who
              may be present, please contact conduct@r-consortium.org.
              Precautions will be taken to ensure your comfort and safety,
              including, but not limited to providing an escort, prepping onsite
              event staff, keeping victim and harasser from attending the same
              talks/social events and providing onsite contact cell phone
              numbers for immediate contact.
