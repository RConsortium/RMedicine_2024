Conference workshops provide a way to learn and develop your R skills. Midweek demos allow you to try out new R packages and tools, and our hackathon provides an opportunity to learn how to develop new R tools. The conference talks share new packages, and successes in analyzing health, laboratory, and clinical data with R and Shiny with a vigorous ongoing discussion with speakers (with pre-recorded talks) in the chat.\n\n\nBROUGHT TO YOU BY\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoin our mailing list to hear all the latest about events, news and more"
