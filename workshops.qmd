## Google BigQuery: First Steps in R

### Abstract

In this hands-on workshop, you’ll use the free tier of Google Cloud Platform to work with large public datasets in Google’s cloud data warehousing solution, BigQuery. We’ll cover topics including:

-   Brief overview of cloud solutions and why they matter in medicine

-   How to sign up for services for free for your own learning

-   Practicing SQL queries in BigQuery

-   Using R and BigQuery together

You’ll leave this workshop with the beginnings of a data analysis of a large public dataset, a Google Cloud account that will allow you to continue learning on your own, and a newfound confidence in SQL, cloud computing, and system interoperability.
