## Tidying your REDCap Data with {REDCapTidieR}

### Abstract

This workshop will use the {REDCap Tidier} package to get clinical data out of REDCap and prepare it for analysis. REDCap is an electronic data capture software that is widely used in the medical research community. The REDCapR package streamlines calls to the REDCap API from an R environment. One of REDCapR’s main uses is to import records from a REDCap project. This works well for simple projects, however this workflow becomes fugly when complex databases that include longitudinal structure and/or repeating instruments are used.

The REDCapTidieR package aims to make the life of analysts who deal with complex REDCap databases easier. It builds upon REDCapR to make its output tidier. Instead of one large data frame that contains all the data from your project, you get to work with a set of tidy tibbles, one for each REDCap instrument.

### Stephan Kadauke and Will Beasley on the Web

## Enhancing Scientific Equity: A Spanish Introduction to Using R for Biostatistical and Data Science Programming

### Abstract

Despite the abundant resources available for learning R, most of these materials are primarily accessible to English speakers. This language barrier significantly restricts access for individuals who do not speak English proficiently. As a result, Spanish-speaking communities often face considerable challenges in accessing software training opportunities. This disparity leads to inequities in the distribution and utilization of scientific technologies, which is particularly concerning given the increasing importance of digital skills nowadays. To mitigate these challenges and promote inclusivity, we propose conducting a programming workshop in Spanish during the conference. This initiative aims to bridge the gap by providing Spanish-speaking participants with equal opportunities to engage with and benefit from technological advancements. By doing so, we not only enhance individual capabilities but also contribute to a more equitable distribution of educational resources in the scientific community. This workshop will equip attendees with basic skills in R. Our primary objective is to familiarize participants with RStudio and its key features for generating reproducible reports. We will guide attendees through the process of creating and managing projects in RStudio and introduce them to creating reproducible manuscripts using Quarto documents. The workshop will utilize a publicly available dataset from the CDC, which contains information on drug use and suicidal ideation among adolescents, as a practical example of using R for academic research in public health. We will explain how to use functions such as filter, mutate, summarize, and select from the tidyverse suite of packages. We will conclude by demonstrating how to use ggplot2 to create visualizations in R. By the end of the workshop, participants will have created a, reproducible document in HTML format, detailing the data cleaning steps and analysis of a significant, contemporary social issue. This presentation aims to close the gap in programming literacy among Spanish-speaking researchers and promote methods for reproducible scientific inquiry.

## Promover la Equidad Científica: Una Introducción al uso de R para la programación en Bioestadística y Ciencia de Datos, en Español.

### Resumen

A pesar de los abundantes recursos disponibles para aprender R, la mayoría de estos materiales son accesibles principalmente para angloparlantes. Esta barrera del idioma restringe significativamente el acceso de personas que no hablan inglés con fluidez. Como resultado, las comunidades de habla hispana a menudo enfrentan desafíos considerables para acceder a oportunidades de capacitación en software. Esta disparidad conduce a desigualdades en la distribución y utilización de las tecnologías científicas, lo que es particularmente preocupante dada la creciente importancia de las habilidades digitales en la actualidad. Para mitigar estos desafíos y promover la inclusión, proponemos realizar un taller de programación en español durante la conferencia. Esta iniciativa tiene como objetivo cerrar la brecha brindando a los participantes de habla hispana igualdad de oportunidades para interactuar y beneficiarse de los avances tecnológicos. Al hacerlo, no sólo mejoramos las capacidades individuales sino que también contribuimos a una distribución más equitativa de los recursos educativos en la comunidad científica. Este taller equipará a los asistentes con habilidades básicas en R. Nuestro objetivo principal es familiarizar a los participantes con RStudio y sus características clave para generar informes reproducibles. Guiaremos a los asistentes a través del proceso de creación y gestión de proyectos en RStudio y les presentaremos la creación de manuscritos reproducibles utilizando documentos Quarto. El taller utilizará un conjunto de datos disponible públicamente de los CDC, que contiene información sobre el uso de drogas y la ideación suicida entre adolescentes, como un ejemplo práctico del uso de R para la investigación académica en salud pública. Explicaremos cómo utilizar funciones como filtrar, mutar, resumir y seleccionar del conjunto de paquetes tidyverse. Concluiremos demostrando cómo usar ggplot2 para crear visualizaciones en R. Al final del taller, los participantes habrán creado un documento reproducible en formato HTML, detallando los pasos de limpieza de datos y el análisis de un problema social contemporáneo importante. Esta presentación tiene como objetivo cerrar la brecha en la alfabetización en programación entre los investigadores de habla hispana y promover métodos para la investigación científica reproducible.

## Project Oriented Workflows

### Abstract

In this workshop, we will establish the concept of and apply best practices to RStudio projects as a basic organizational unit of work. This includes creating robust file paths that travel well in time and space; constructing human and machine readable file names that sort nicely; differentiating workflow elements, analysis inputs, and analysis outputs in project structure; and restarting R frequently, with a blank slate. Upon completion of this workshop, you will have strategies for creating organized and reproducible data analysis projects.

## Tidy Time Series

### Abstract

This workshop provides a practical introduction to time series analytics and forecasting using R, utilising the tidyverse and tidy time series tools to enable analysis across many time series. Attendees will learn about commonly seen time series patterns, and how to find them with specialised time series graphics created with ggplot2. Then we will use fable to capture these patterns with statistical time series models, and produce probabilistic forecasts. Finally, participants will learn how to evaluate model performance, using accuracy statistics to choose the model which produces the most accurate forecasts. With a combination of foundational concepts and practical demonstrations, this workshop equips participants with the skills to extract meaning from time series data for informed decision-making in various domains.

## From R to PowerPoint: Advanced PowerPoint Presentations Using {officer}

### Abstract

Imagine you’re asked to recreate a beautiful, complex PowerPoint presentation using R. Despite Quarto's wide-reaching superpowers, it only offers six measly layout options for Microsoft PowerPoint. The most complex being the simple “two columns”! So, what should I do?

The answer is not Quarto at all; it’s {officer}! In this workshop, we’ll show the process of recreating complex PowerPoint layouts, using {officer}, whilst addressing the pros and cons of abandoning Quarto.

By the end of this workshop, participants will be able to:
- Understand what possibilities lie within the “Officeverse”
- Why, for complex PowerPoints, {officer} is better than R Markdown and Quarto
- Create complex PowerPoint presentations using {officer}
- Understand how to best combine PowerPoint templates with {officer} for the optimal workflow
- Understand the issues one will encounter when using {officer}
