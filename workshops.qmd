## Causal Inference in R

### Abstract

This workshop will use the NHANES Epidemiologic Follow-up Study (NHEFS) data. In this workshop, we’ll teach the essential elements of answering causal questions in R through causal diagrams, and causal modeling techniques such as propensity scores and inverse probability weighting.

## Google BigQuery: First Steps in R

### Abstract

In this hands-on workshop, you’ll use the free tier of Google Cloud Platform to work with large public datasets in Google’s cloud data warehousing solution, BigQuery. We’ll cover topics including:

-   Brief overview of cloud solutions and why they matter in medicine

-   How to sign up for services for free for your own learning

-   Practicing SQL queries in BigQuery

-   Using R and BigQuery together

You’ll leave this workshop with the beginnings of a data analysis of a large public dataset, a Google Cloud account that will allow you to continue learning on your own, and a newfound confidence in SQL, cloud computing, and system interoperability.

## Next Generation Shiny Apps with {bslib}

### Abstract

Learn to build Shiny apps using modern user interfaces (UI) and layouts with bslib, the next generation of Shiny UI. We’ll cover stylish and convenient dashboard layouts and components as we showcase the ways in which bslib can replace shinydashboard. We’ll also learn about exciting new ways to deploy Shiny apps with shinylive as static sites that run entirely in the user’s browser and don’t require setting up or maintaining a Shiny server.

## Tidying your REDCap Data with {REDCapTidieR}

### Abstract

This workshop will use the {REDCap Tidier} package to get clinical data out of REDCap and prepare it for analysis. REDCap is an electronic data capture software that is widely used in the medical research community. The REDCapR package streamlines calls to the REDCap API from an R environment. One of REDCapR’s main uses is to import records from a REDCap project. This works well for simple projects, however this workflow becomes fugly when complex databases that include longitudinal structure and/or repeating instruments are used.

The REDCapTidieR package aims to make the life of analysts who deal with complex REDCap databases easier. It builds upon REDCapR to make its output tidier. Instead of one large data frame that contains all the data from your project, you get to work with a set of tidy tibbles, one for each REDCap instrument.

### Stephan Kadauke and Will Beasley on the Web

Stephan can be found automating everything at CHOP, on Twitter at [\@StephanKadauke](https://twitter.com/StephanKadauke), and promoting reproducible medical research with R.

Will can be found working on improving [REDCap Workflows](https://ouhscbbmc.github.io/REDCapR/articles/workflow-read.html), and supporting a variety of research studies at OUHSC.
