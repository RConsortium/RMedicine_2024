## **Scholarships: Diversity & Need-Based**

A limited number of complimentary registrations are available to enable community members to attend when they would otherwise be unable due to a lack of funding. We place an emphasis on funding applicants who are from historically underrepresented or untapped groups, from low GDP countries, and/or those of lower socioeconomic status. If you work for a company that has the ability to fund your travel, we ask that you not apply, to save funds for those that need it.

Tell us why you need one of the limited number of complimentary registrations. Limit 500 characters. Submit [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Rnd9GLI9dhQvTYmMRHMWCC9RsJWyQdYacr-vUMNyvAI/edit).
